# user-scripts

My user scripts for web sites, which can be used with a user script manager such as Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and Violentmonkey.

They can be installed from [my Greasy Fork profile](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1155144-jcfields) or [my OpenUserJS profile](https://openuserjs.org/users/jcfields). Installing from one of the sites also updates the scripts automatically.
